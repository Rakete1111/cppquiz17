[expr.typeid]§5.2.8¶1: "The result of a `typeid` expression is an lvalue of static type `const std::type_info`",
and
[expr.unary.op]§5.3.1¶3: "The result of the unary `&` operator is a pointer to its operand",
so we're comparing two pointers to `const std::type_info`.

There is no guarantee that the same `std::type_info` instance will be referred to by all evaluations of the `typeid` expression on the same type, although `std::type_info::hash_code` of those `type_info` objects would be identical, as would be their `std::type_index`.

(For more info on `hash_code(), see` [type.info]§18.7.1¶7 : "`hash_code()` (...)shall return the same value for any two `type_info` objects which compare equal")

(For more info on `type_index` equality, see [type.index.members]§20.13.3 and [type.info]§18.7.1)
