According to [intro.execution]§1.9¶15 in the standard, when calling a function, every value computation and side effect associated with any argument expression, is **sequenced before the function is entered**. Hence, in the expression `f(i++)`, `f` is called with a parameter of the original value of `i`, but `i` is incremented before entering the body of `f`.
