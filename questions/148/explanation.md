The issue here is not the missing initializer of the variable `a` - it will implicitly be initialized to `0` here. But the issue is the access to `a` twice without sequencing between the accesses. According to [intro.execution]§1.9¶12, accesses of volatile glvalues are side-effects and according to [intro.execution]§1.9¶15 these two unsequenced side-effects on the same scalar object result in undefined behavior.
